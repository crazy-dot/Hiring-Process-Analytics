Analyse the company's hiring process data and draw meaningful insights from it. I have used Excel to analyse the dataset.

Data Analytics Tasks Performed :
A. Hiring Analysis: The hiring process involves bringing new individuals into the organization for various roles.
Task: Determine the gender distribution of hires. How many males and females have been hired by the company?

B. Salary Analysis: The average salary is calculated by adding up the salaries of a group of employees and then dividing the total by the number of employees.
Task: What is the average salary offered by this company? Use Excel functions to calculate this.

C. Salary Distribution: Class intervals represent ranges of values, in this case, salary ranges. The class interval is the difference between the upper and lower limits of a class.
Task: Create class intervals for the salaries in the company. This will help you understand the salary distribution.

Task: Use a pie chart, bar graph, or any other suitable visualization to show the proportion of people working in different departments.

E. Position Tier Analysis: Different positions within a company often have different tiers or levels.
